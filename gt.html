        <hr>
        <p>These are the great rhombates, omnitruncates (great prismates), and those with similar vertex figures. These are all lone operatives because their vertex figures are tetrahedra.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Great rhombates</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center;">These are the cantitruncated honeycombs and those with related vertex figures. The vertex figures are bilaterally-symmetric tetrahedra. Grich, cuteca, dacta, gaqrich, and caquiteca have chon symmetry while the others have octet symmetry.</p>
        <p><b>92. Grich</b> - Great rhombated cubic honeycomb, also called cantitruncated cubic honeycomb. Cells are gircoes, cubes, and toes. Symbol is o4x3x4x or x3x4x *b3x.</p>
        <p><b>93. Gratoh</b> - Great rhombated tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb. Cells are gircoes, tics, and tuts. Symbol is x3x4x *b3o.</p>
        <p><b>94. Cuteca</b> - Cubatitruncated cubatiapeiratic honeycomb. Cells are cotcoes, toes, and tosquats. Symbol is o4x3x4/3x4*b or x3x4x4x3*a4/3*c.</p>
        <p><b>95. Dacta</b> - Dicubatitruncated apeiratic honeycomb. Cells are satsas, tics, and quiths. Symbol is o3x4x~x4/3*b.</p>
        <p><b>96. Gaqrich</b> - Great quasirhombated cubic honeycomb. Cells are quitcoes, cubes, and toes. Symbol is o4x3x4/3x or x3x4/3x *b3x.</p>
        <p><b>97. Gaqratoh</b> (also called gaqrahch) - Great quasirhombated tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb. Cells are quitcoes, quiths, and tuts. Symbol is x3x4/3x *b3o.</p>
        <p><b>98. Caquiteca</b> - Cubatiquasitruncated cubatiapeiratic honeycomb. Cells are cotcoes, toes, and quitsquats. Symbol is o4x3x4x4/3*b or x3x4/3x4/3x3*a4*c.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Omnitruncates</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center;">These are the omnitruncates of Wythoffian families. The vertex figures of gippich, quequapech, and dacda are phyllic disphenoids, the rest are irregular tetrahedra. Gippich, quequapech, and dacda have doubled chon symmetry, cadca and dicroch have octet symmetry, and the rest have chon symmetry.</p>

        <p><b>101. Gactipeca</b> - Great cubatitruncated prismatocubatiapeiratic honeycomb. Cells are cotcoes, quitcoes, qrasquits, and stops. Symbol is x4/3x3x4/3x4*b.</p>
        <p><b>102. Dactapa</b> - Dicubatitruncated prismatoapeiratic honeycomb. Cells are satsas, gircoes, quitcoes, and azips. Symbol is x3x4x~x4/3*b.</p>
        <p><b>103. Cadca</b> - Cubatidicubatiapeiratic honeycomb. Cells are gircoes, quitcoes, toes, and qrasquits. Symbol is x3x3x4x4/3*a.</p>
        <p><b>104. Dicroch</b> - Dicubatirhombated cubatihexagonal honeycomb. Cells are cotcoes, gircoes, quitcoes, and hexats. Symbol is x3x3x4x4/3*a3*c.</p>
