        <hr>
        <p>This is an attempt to list all known uniform Euclidean 3-dimensional honeycombs. The style of this list and the names were inspired by Jonathan Bowers' <a href="http://polytope.net/hedrondude/polychora.htm">list of uniform polychora</a>, which you should really check out.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Uniform honeycomb categories</h2>
        <p><b>Category A: Polygon-apeirogon duoprisms</b> - This is the infinite set of duoprisms between an apeirogon and any regular polygon (not counting an apeirogon). Each of them looks like a column of n-gonal prisms, with apeirogonal prisms on the sides.</p>
        <p><b>Category B: Subdivisions</b> - These are the honeycombs with multiple apeiratic cells in the same plane. Their vertex figures have coplanar faces. For each honeycomb in this category, there is an analogous honeycomb somewhere else where each stack of apeiratic cells is replaced by a single apeiratic cell.</p>
        <p><b><a href="primaries.html">Category 1</a>: Primaries</b> - The two members of the chon regiment with full (o4o3o4x) or half (o3o4x *b3o) symmetry, as well as the fully symmetric members of the octet regiment.</p>
        <p><b><a href="truncates.html">Category 2</a>: Truncates</b> - These are the truncates of the honeycombs from category 1 that have uniform vertex figures.</p>
        <p><b><a href="rich.html">Category 3</a>: Rich regiment</b> - Rich is the rectified cubic honeycomb. Its regiment contains 49 members, whose vertex figures are facetings of square prisms.</p>
        <p><b><a href="sphenoverts.html">Category 4</a>: Sphenoverts</b> - These are the honeycombs with wedge-shaped vertex figures and their regiments.</p>
        <p><b><a href="gt.html">Category 5</a>: Greater truncates</b> - These are the great rhombates and great prismates and their kin. The vertex figures are various types of irregular tetrahedra.</p>
        <p><b><a href="prismatorhombates.html">Category 6</a>: Prismatorhombates</b> - These are the prismatorhombates (runcicantellates) and others with similar vertex figures, and their regiments. Their vertex figures are trapezoid pyramids./p>
        <p><b><a href="podiumverts.html">Category 7</a>: Triangular podiumverts</b> - These are the honeycombs with triangular podia or antipodia as their vertex figures, and their regiments.</p>
        <p><b><a href="gacoca.html">Category 8</a>: Gacoca regiment</b> - The gacoca regiment has 66 members whose vertex figures are facetings of a square podium (frustum). <!-- Including antifrustumverts --></p>
        <p><b><a href="skewverts.html">Category 9</a>: Skewverts</b> - These are the honeycombs with skewed wedges as vertex figures, and their regiments.</p>
        <p><b><a href="ditets.html">Category 10</a>: Ditetrahedronaries</b> - These are the members of the octet regiment with cyclotettic symmetry. They have tetrahedrally symmetric vertex figures.</p>
        <p><b>Category 11: Stut cadoca regiment</b></p>
        <p><b>Category 12: Prismatic honeycombs and their regiments</b></p>
        <p><b>Category 13: Prisms</b></p>
        <p><b>Category 14: Other slabs</b></p>
        <p><b>Category 15: Gyrates and elongates</b></p>
