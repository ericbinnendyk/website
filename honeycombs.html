        <hr>
        <p>This is an attempt to list all known uniform Euclidean 3-dimensional honeycombs. The style of this list and the names were inspired by Jonathan Bowers' <a href="http://polytope.net/hedrondude/polychora.htm">list of uniform polychora</a>, which you should really check out.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Uniform honeycomb categories</h2>
        <p><b>Category A: Polygon-apeirogon duoprisms</b> - This is the infinite set of duoprisms between an apeirogon and any regular polygon (not counting an apeirogon). Each of them looks like a column of n-gonal prisms, with apeirogonal prisms on the sides.</p>
        <p><b>Category B: Subdivisions</b> - These are the honeycombs with multiple apeiratic cells in the same plane. Their vertex figures have coplanar faces. For each honeycomb in this category, there is an analogous honeycomb somewhere else where each stack of apeiratic cells is replaced by a single apeiratic cell.</p>
        <p><b><a href="primaries.html">Category 1</a>: Primaries</b> - The two members of the chon regiment with full (o4o3o4x) or half (o3o4x *b3o) symmetry, as well as the fully symmetric members of the octet regiment.</p>
        <p><b>Category 2: Truncates</b> - These are the truncates of the honeycombs from category 1 that have uniform vertex figures.</p>
        <p><b>Category 3: Rich regiment</b> <!-- I decided that this would be the entire rich regiment, not just the full symmetrics--></p>
        <p><b>Category 4: Sphenoverts</b></p>
        <p><b>Category 5: Greater truncates</b></p>
        <p><b>Category 6: Prismatorhombates</b></p>
        <p><b>Category 7: Triangular podiumverts</b></p>
        <p><b>Category 8: Gacoca regiment</b> <!-- Including antifrustumverts --></p>
        <p><b>Category 9: Skewverts</b></p>
        <p><b>Category 10: Ditetrahedronaries</b></p>
        <p><b>Category 11: Stut cadoca regiment</b></p>
        <p><b>Category 12: Prismatic honeycombs and their regiments</b></p>
        <p><b>Category 13: Prisms</b></p>
        <p><b>Category 14: Other slabs</b></p>
        <p><b>Category 15: Gyrates and elongates</b></p>
