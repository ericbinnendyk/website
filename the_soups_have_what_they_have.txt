[Verse 1]
I've been running a number
I can't compare to nothing
Of patterns on apgsearch,
Just hoping to find something very rare

Some people may say I'm crazy,
But to find it would be amazing,
And every day I am saying
That I won't have much more to bear

[Chorus]
We've almost had this for half a year
The future status of Life is so unclear
But I'm not alive until it's there
I know what the odds against it are
13 billion to 1, I know it's rare
And hoping for it won't make it there
There's a million reasons why I shouldn't have seen one yet
But the soups have what they have, ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-have,
The soups have what they have, ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-have,
The soups have what they have, ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-have,
The soups have what they have, ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-have

[Verse 2]
It breaks the patterns in pieces
Seeing if they're connected
Finding very rare patterns
But then they disappear and are not saved

And every second's like torture
Waiting to see caterers
Making accounts on forums
But until I see it you know I can't escape

[Chorus]
We've almost had this for half a year
The future status of Life is so unclear
But I'm not alive until it's there
I know what the odds against it are
13 billion to 1, I know it's rare
And hoping for it won't make it there
There's a million reasons why I shouldn't have seen one yet
But the soups have what they have, ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-have,
The soups have what they have, ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-have,
The soups have what they have, ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-have,
The soups have what they have, ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-have

[Bridge]
We're making modern Life history
Running apgsearch with symmetry
But I can't imagine a life without
Ever finding this great pattern out, out, out, out

[Chorus]
We've almost had this for half a year
The future status of Life is so unclear
But I'm not alive until it's there
I know what the odds against it are
13 billion to 1, I know it's rare
And hoping for it won't make it there
There's a million reasons why I shouldn't have seen one yet
But the soups have what they have, ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-have,
The soups have what they have, ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-have,
The soups have what they have, ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-have,
The soups have what they have, ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-ha-have, ha-have

[Outro]
The soups have what they have
The soups have what they have
The soups have what they have
