            <li>The full decimal expansion of <a href="333667^333667.txt">333667^333667</a> (note: possibly incorrect because I recently noticed it contains groups of 7 consecutive 0s when my code was supposed to generate groups of 6 digits). This was the first program I wrote to do arithmetic on numbers too large to fit in built-in types. <a href="333667_v2.c">C source</a></li>
