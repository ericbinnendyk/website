        <h1>4th Power Poem</h1>
        <p>I wrote this poem on May 26, 2012.</p>
        <p>The rhyming scheme has to do with the last digits of the 4th powers up to 50^4.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>This morning I woke up, and it was day<br>
        Even though I wished that it was the night<br>
        In the morning I don't have time to play<br>
        I must do things the grownups think are right<br>
        Like take a shower. So I did. And I've<br>
        Always thought of some numbers to recite<br>
        Because I take a shower every day<br>
        I have to think of numbers to recite<br>
        So I recited my numbers away<br>
        And then I got out.
        </p>
        <p>When I was done showering, then I sat<br>
        Down at my place, which usually was Ruby's<br>
        It was a bit strange when I thought of that<br>
        Then I listened to Wait Wait Don't Tell Me<br>
        After the show, then noontime did arrive<br>
        I went to NMSU with Ruby<br>
        And when we went there, Ruby saw some cats<br>
        I thought about the poem that you see<br>
        Then Ruby went and tried to pet those cats<br>
        And soon we went home.
        </p>
        <p>I had a big plan for when we got home<br>
        It came from an idea that was new<br>
        I would sit down and try to write the poem<br>
        That I'd thought about at NMSU<br>
        With rhyme scheme that went 1-6-1-6-5<br>
        I would write my thoughts from NMSU<br>
        So I sat down and tried to write the poem<br>
        I wrote that the idea, it was new<br>
        I did my big plan after we went home<br>
        And soon I'll finish.
        </p>
        <p>I wrote about how Ruby saw some cats<br>
        It was part of the poem that you see<br>
        I wrote about how Ruby pet those cats<br>
        I wrote of NMSU and Ruby<br>
        I wrote about how noontime did arrive<br>
        After the show of Wait Wait Don't Tell Me<br>
        And then I wrote about how I thought that<br>
        My place this morning usually was Ruby's<br>
        I wrote about this morning, and I sat<br>
        And wrote even more.
        </p>
        <p>I wrote of reciting numbers away<br>
        Wrote that I thought of numbers to recite<br>
        Wrote that I take a shower every day<br>
        And in the shower, numbers I recite<br>
        I wrote of showers. Yes I did. And I've<br>
        Got only four more lines I need to write<br>
        I wrote of how I don't have time to play<br>
        In the morning, but I can play at night<br>
        It certainly had been a busy day<br>
        And now my poem's done!<br>
