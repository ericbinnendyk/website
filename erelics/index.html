        <h1>Erelics</h1>
        <p>This is a page for works I created when I was younger which I think should be preserved. The name "Erelics" is inspired by Cary Huang's "<a href="https://htwins.net/carelics/">Carelics</a>" page.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="the_soups_have_what_they_have.txt">The Soups Have What They Have</a>, a song parody about searching patterns in Conway's Game of Life.</li>
            <li><a href="Non-notable_Properties_of_Specific_Numbers.pdf">Non-notable Properties of Specific Numbers</a>, made by me in December 2014. A parody of Robert Munafo's webpage "Notable Properties of Specific Numbers"</li>
            <li>A <a href="4th_power_poem/">4th power poem</a> about my life in 2012, where every line follows the digits of a 4th power up to 50^4</li>
            <li><a href="1_to_100/">All the numbers from 1 to 100</a>, a song based on Yakko's World</li>
