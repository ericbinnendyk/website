        <h1>Erelics</h1>
        <p>This is a page for works I created when I was younger which I think should be preserved. The name "Erelics" is inspired by Cary Huang's "<a href="https://htwins.net/carelics/">Carelics</a>" page.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="1_to_100/">All the numbers from 1 to 100</a>, a song based on Yakko's World</li>
            <li>A <a href="4th_power_poem/">4th power poem</a> about my life in 2012, where every line follows the digits of a 4th power up to 50^4</li>
        </ul>
