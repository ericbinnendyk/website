        <p>These are the honeycombs with triangular podia or antipodia as their vertex figures, and their regiments.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;">Chon regiment continued</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center;">These are the members of the chon (cubic honeycomb) regiment that have x4o3o4x symmetry or doubled x4o3o4x symmetry. Their vertex figures are facetings of an oct with triangular antiprismatic or pyramidal symmetry.</p>
        <p><b>137. Dacha</b> - Dicubatihemiapeiratic honeycomb. Cells are cubes (in the polar positions) and shas. Verf is a triangular bowtie prism. Symbol is o3o4x~x4/3*c. This has doubled x4o3o4x symmetry.</p>
        <p><b>138. Dapha</b> - Disprismatohemiapeiratic honeycomb. Cells are cubes (in the equatorial positions) and shas. Verf is an inverted triangular antiprism. This has doubled x4o3o4x symmetry.</p>
        <p><b>139. Napca</b> - Spinoprismatocubatiapeiratic honeycomb. Cells are cubes (one of two sets of both equatorial and polar positions) and shas. Verf is a spiky faceting of an oct. This has x4o3o4x symmetry.</p>

        <p><b>140. Batatoh</b> - Cyclotruncated tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb, also called quarter cubic honeycomb or bitruncated tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb (even though it isn't a bitruncated tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb). Cells are tets and tuts. Symbol is o3o3x3x3*a. Batatoh has doubled o3o3o3o3*a symmetry.</p>
        <p><b>141. Datha</b> - Ditetrahemiapeiratic honeycomb. Cells are tets and thas. Symbol is o3o3x~x3/2*b. Datha has doubled o3o3o3o3*a symmetry.</p>
        <p><b>142. Idatha</b> - Inverted ditetrahemiapeiratic honeycomb. Cells are tuts and thas. Idatha has doubled o3o3o3o3*a symmetry.</p>
        <p><b>143. Tota</b> - Tetratetraapeiratic honeycomb. Cells are tets, tuts, and thats. Tota has o3o3o3o3*a symmetry.</p>
        <p><b>144. Nateta</b> - Spinotetratetraapeiratic honeycomb. Cells are tets, tuts, and hohas. Nateta has o3o3o3o3*a symmetry.</p>
