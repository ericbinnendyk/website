        <hr>
        <p>Rich is the rectified cubic honeycomb. The rich regiment contains 49 members with four symmetries: chonnic (o4o3x4o), octettic with one edge type (o3x4o *b3o), octettic with two edge types (x3o4o *b3x), and cyclotettic (o3x3o3x3*a). Their vertex figures are facetings of square prisms. There's also a compound of batches. The latter two symmetries were previously put in separate categories called "square podiumverts" and "antifrustumverts" but I decided to merge them into this category.</p>
